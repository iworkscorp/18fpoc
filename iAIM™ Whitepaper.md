## Introduction
iWorks Corporation’s (iWorks) process, iWorks Agile Implementation Methodology (iAIM™), enables Government agencies to reap the benefits that the commercial sector enjoys with rapid, flexible application development and systems integrations while meeting Government documentation requirements and accelerating stage gate approvals in firm fixed-price procurements.

## Barriers to Agile
As developed in the commercial sector, Agile methodology engages clients in an collaborative and evolutionary approach to develop software – resulting in solutions that meet evolving needs in shorter time frames. Historically, it has been difficult to implement Agile in the Government because of the strict adherence to traditional Systems Development Life Cycles (SDLC), which dictate that requirements and documentation are determined prior to commencing with development. Additionally, Government contracting regulations pose a hurdle for firm fixed-price contracts for system integrators utilizing Agile.

Many Federal agencies have been reluctant to adopt Agile because of the perception that Agile is comprised of uncoordinated cycles of development resulting in portions of a solution that will not survive on their own through the internal clearance and approval processes resulting in spiraling costs.

With the wrong development team, Agile becomes endless cycles of development of uncoordinated functional sprints with stage gates looming as insurmountable barriers and release times in the unforeseeable future. 

## The iAIM™ Advantage
To address the issue of disjointed sprints, iAIM™ simultaneously manages two critical timelines, the Application Development Timeline and the Functional Release Timeline. With this two-timeline approach, iWorks’ Project Managers are able to schedule sprints in logical groupings to ensure that the development maps to the release timelines. This approach enables iWorks to accurately predict schedules and costs in a firm-fixed price procurement.

In addition to managing two timelines to better coordinate releases, iAIM™ facilitates stage gate approvals by using Integrated Planning Teams (IPT). The involvement of the IPT in the iterative process ensures that clients get exactly what they want when they want it. The stage gate process is accelerated as the clients have collaborated in the requirements, development and testing phases. 

## Real-time documentation
It is often assumed that with Agile methodology clients do not get the documentation they need. With iAIM™ we address this concern by embedding technical writers in the Scrum. We are able to produce real-time documentation to address SDLC required documentation at every phase of the SDLC process. Additionally, iAIM™ provides clients with real-time training manuals for internal and external users. 

## Testing
Some agencies are concerned that Agile cannot accommodate testing in the development phase. iAIM™ addresses that concern by conducting testing throughout the process. We capture and apply metrics such as mean time to break in advance of production. Our testers work on-site in iWorks Lab and are able to identify errors so they can be addressed prior to release.

## Past Performance
iAIM™ has been successfully deployed at Department of Defense (DoD) Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) in the development of a case adjudication system for security clearance. Key success factors include: three week cycle time, daily project and team scrums and monthly releases. Below is a sample of the tools and applications that iWorks uses in the iAIM™ process. 

## Success Story
iAIM™ hits the bullseye every time.  The benefits of iAIM™ are clear:
* Engages clients in the process
* Accelerates cycle times
* Addresses evolving/ changing needs
* Provides real-time documentation
* Enables stage gate approvals
* Incorporates testing and metrics in development
* Provides predictable costs
* Meets milestone deliverables
* Produces high quality deliverables
