| a | assigned one leader, gave that person authority and responsibility, and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted | Fully met - iWorks' management team reviewed the RFQ requirements and identified Scott Kerr to lead the effort and gave him the authority and accountability for the quality of the prototype.| Link to Project  Plan: https://github.com/iworkscorp/18fpoc/blob/master/Project_Plan.md The Project Plan shows how Scott Kerr planned the work to complete the prototype.|
| b | assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that includes at a minimum of two of the labor categories limited to the Development Pool labor categories to develop the prototype as quoted in Attachment C  | "Fully met - As Agile Coach and leader for the quality of the prototype, Scott Kerr assembled a team of experts consisting of - Scott Kerr - Technical Architect, Frontend Developer - Andrew Tzikas - Technical Architect, Frontend Developer - Faraz Izadi - Technical Architect, Frontend Developer - Harjit Singh - DevOps Engineer, Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Technical Architect| "Link to History of Logged Issues: https://github.com/iworkscorp/18fpoc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed" "Link to GitHub repository: https://github.com/iworkscorp/18fpoc The closed issues and work items in the repository show the different team members and work that they contributed"|
| c |used at least five modern and open-source technologies, regardless of architectural layer (frontend, backend, etc.)|Fully met - the team used the following technologies: ▪Groovy – An object-oriented open-source JVM language for Java. ▪Grails – An open-source web application framework used to host the prototype. It leverages the Groovy programming language. ▪Bootstrap – A front end framework that helps provide the interface for users. It allows the prototype to be responsive to various browser and mobile applications. ▪D3.Js – A JavaScript library for producing the interactive map as a data visualization tool ▪JQuery – Is integrated to allow client side scripting on the browser. ▪High-Maps - An HTML 5 mapping component using the Highcharts Java API. The tool provides the application with an interactive map with drill-down capabilities. ▪Travis CI – An open-source tool to test and deploy the prototype. ▪Google Maps - An API allowing our application to enable geo-coding properties. | *Grails: https://github.com/iworkscorp/18fpoc/tree/master/grails-app * Bootstrap: https://github.com/iworkscorp/18fpoc/tree/master/grails-app/assets/javascripts/bootstrap * D3.Js, JQuery, High-Maps.Js: https://github.com/iworkscorp/18fpoc/blob/master/grails-app/views/layouts/main.gsp *Travis CI: https://github.com/iworkscorp/18fpoc/blob/master/.travis.yml" *Google Maps: https://github.com/iworkscorp/18fpoc/blob/master/grails-app/assets/javascripts/sb-admin-2.js
| d |deployed the prototype on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider, and indicated which provider they used|Fully met - The prototype is deployed as a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) web application, and uses Open shift from Redhat as its host, as evidenced in the"".rhcloud.com"" domain.  The prototype is accessible at http://18fpocdev-iworksfda.rhcloud.com |Link to prototype: http://18fpocdev-iworksfda.rhcloud.com/ |
| e |wrote unit tests for their code |Fully met - Used Grails to generate unit test stubs for Grails components.  Customized unit tests to test methods and code blocks within components and to confirm expected behavior when different parameters are passed to the component. Created integration tests to test end-to-end user scenarios for providing search query parameters and generating   API query statements.|Links to Unit Tests: https://github.com/iworkscorp/18fpoc/blob/master/test/unit/com/iworks/PocControllerSpec.groovy https://github.com/iworkscorp/18fpoc/blob/master/test/unit/com/iworks/PocServiceSpec.groovy These links show the Point test file in Github, results of tests, and what the tests are checking|
| f | set up or used a continuous integration system to automate the running of tests and continuously deployed their code to their IaaS or PaaS provider | Fully met - The team used the Travis CI open-source tool to automatically deploy the prototype on Openshift.  Travis CI offered seamless integration with GitHub, which is a primary reason for selecting Travis CI as the continuous integration system to automate running unit and functional tests, as well as enable continuous deployment. | Link to Travis CI: Script: https://github.com/iworkscorp/18fpoc/blob/master/.travis.yml Link to Travis CI Repository: https://travis-ci.org/iworkscorp/18fpoc To view testing of the code being deployed, visit the Travis CI Repository |
| g | set up or used configuration management | Fully met - To establish and maintain consistency of a prototype's  performance, functional and physical attributes with the requirements and design, the team used GitHub that is built on Git, a distributed version control system. The team integrated GitHub with TravisCI to implement an automated build process that supports continuous integration. | Link to Team's Github site: https://github.com/iworkscorp/18fpoc |
| h | set up or used continuous monitoring | "Fully met - Using the GitHub Commit Status API, any  unique merge conditions can be detected for investigation and follow-up to determine if that are any securirty or compliance concerns. This prototype is deployed on Redhat's OpenShift which is proactively managed by Redhat as part of packages that make up Redhat Enterprise which include industry-leading responsiveness to security vulnerabilities. The OpenShift PaaS is hardened using industry-leading technologies and techniques. Network Transport is actively monitored on Openshift.  Private data and logins exchanged with OpenShift is transmitted over SSL (the Openshift web interface utilizes HTTP Strict Transport Security). Application passwords are filtered from OpenShift log files and encrypted. Pushing and pulling of private data is done over SSH authenticated with keys, not passwords, to help prevent brute force cracking. Tools are available for users to deploy similar steps for their applications. Red Hat's Product Security Team helps identify prevent new exploits.  This team frequently tests exploits such as cross site scripting (XSS) and that cookie permissions are set appropriately. | The following link is used to view the status of our application: http://18fpocdev-iworksfda.rhcloud.com/haproxy-status/ |
| i | deploy their software in a container (i.e., utilized operating-system-level virtualization) | Fully met - The team used Docker as the virtualized operating system contained.  Apache Tomcat's servlet container was used to deploy the prototype. | Link to Dockerfile: https://github.com/iworkscorp/18fpoc/blob/developer/Dockerfile This file is the virtualized operating system container used in the prototype. |
| j | used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype | Fully met - By following Rapid Prototyping methodology, the team performed continuous analysis of the protoype's design,  architecture, and development.  Stakeholder feedback was received, analyzed, prioritized, and implemented in consecutive iterations.  Functionalities that are considered important but not implemented, due to time constraints and other priorities within the prototype, are recorded in Github and tagged for future iterations.  The team used Github as their Project Management Tracking Platform, which enabled them to create and track changes with a high level of transparency. | Link to Mockup: https://github.com/iworkscorp/18fpoc/issues/22 The mockups show the progression and continual iterations of the approach to reach a final prototype design. |
