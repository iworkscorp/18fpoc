The approach taken for the Agile BPA prototype was iWorks' patented iAIM approach.

To start, Scott Kerr was identified as the leader, and created the schedule for the project as the first step.  He set daily stand-up meetings for the team to review progress and raise issues or questions.  Next, a team of four resources was assembled, combining expertise in five categories: product manager, agile coach, technical architect, frontend web developer, backend web developer, business analyst, and visual designer.  <Add testing into the resource mix> These four resources scheduled a kick-off meeting in which the design of the prototype was created.

Additional resources were included in the kickoff meeting, including those who served as the voice of a "typical user."
